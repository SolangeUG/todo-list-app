This project is a basic single-page Angular application using the MEAN stack (MongoDB for our database, NodeJS/Express for the server, and AngularJS as our front-end framework).

## Languages - Libraries - Tools

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [AngularJS](https://angular.io/)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)s
- Any code/text editor ([atom](https://atom.io/) for example)

## Starting the application

This app requires that the user has MongoDB and Node installed on their machines. Once these have been properly configured, simply run the `npm install` or `yarn install` commands.

To start the server, simply run the `npm start` (or `nodemon server.js` if you have it installed) in your terminal.
